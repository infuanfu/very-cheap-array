The VERY-CHEAP-ARRAY is the idea of building open source hard- and software for a primitive, easy-to-build, open source radio-telescope. The project is a contribution to citizen-science. It aims at gaining and sharing insights in the field of radioastronomy as well as physics of radio-stuff, electronics and science in general.
